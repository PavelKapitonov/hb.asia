'text-16' => " SINGING BOWLS APPLICATION TECHNIQUES",
'text-17' => "<p>The worldwide consensus highlights the beneficial impact of sound and vibration emitted by singing bowls on various bodily systems. Dr. V.P. Surikov, an anesthetist and resuscitator, has devised methodologies that consistently yield anticipated positive results. In 2013, the techniques for using singing bowls, authored by Dr. Surikov, underwent thorough international testing. Since then, these methodologies have been effectively applied in the contexts of sanatoriums, resorts, SPAs, and wellness centers.</p>

<p>In 2015,Dr. V.P. Surikov conducted training for RUDN students in his MVAM (Microcirculatory Vibrational-Acoustic Massage) methodology as a component of a program aimed at enhancing the qualifications of medical professionals.</p>",
'text-18' => "<p> The remarkable efficacy of Healingbowl's techniques piqued the interest of researchers around the world investigating the realm of sound. This allowed Dr. Surikov's presentation to be included in the program of a private International Congress. Esteemed professors hailing from Germany and Russia, renowned for their commitment to exploring and implementing cutting-edge non-pharmaceutical therapeutic approaches within the realm of sanatoriums and resorts, were also featured in this event.
In collaboration with Antonina Aleksandrovna Kozyreva, a Clinical Psychologist and Healingbowl Instructor, Dr. Surikov, an anesthetist and resuscitator and creator of the Healingbowl methodology, undertook a series of researchers. This involved exploring four distinct techniques and conducting approximately 30 therapeutic-diagnostic sessions, with participants willingly partaking from the Congress. These sessions were closely supervised and facilitated by the Software-Hardware Complex 'VALEOSCAN'. This advanced system employs contemporary metrological tools to comprehensively assess the biophysical parameters of organs, tissues, and functional systems within the human body, thereby providing an insightful evaluation of individuals' immune statuses. </p>,

<p>Throughout the course of the research, patients' metrics were recorded both prior to and following the sessions, over a period of four days. The outcomes of the techniques employing our vibroacoustic resonators exceeded all expectations, demonstrating a robust average growth of the studied parameters by 85%. The medical equipment is employed in diagnostic centers across Europe, leaving no room for doubt regarding the reliability of the examination.

On the last day of the International Congress, Dr. V.P. Surikov delivered a presentation elucidating the efficacy of sound resonance therapy and unveiling the results gleaned from the patient assessments. The esteemed participants of the congress, who were actively engaged in the sessions themselves, included luminaries such as academician and professor Mashkov O.A., psychiatrist and professor Bilits K., professor Shotler V., professor and medical doctor Karbysheva N.V., and professor Anisimov B.N., among others.
